Url List Viewer
===============
URL is a minimaliste browser that aim to move threw a list of urls that are in
a file. It has been created to serves as a viewer for newsbeuter.

Installation
------------
ULR need python 2.6, pygtk, gobject and pywebkit for gtk.

Usage
-----
Simply put some urls into the file "urls" in the same dir that ULR then launch
it.
If you give ULR a command line arg it will put it into the urls file.

Also, it's not very optimised, if you want to speed this up write a .sh file
containing a shebang a "echo $1 >> /path/to/urls"


Shortcut
--------
 * esc/q - quit without saving the progress in the list
 * n/space - move to the next url in the list
 * b/p - move to the previous url in the list
 * r - reload the current page
 * s - save the current position in the list (remove the already seen url from
   the urls file)
 * S - same as s but quit just after
 * y - paste the url into the xclipboard (need xclip)
 * f - send the url to firefox (need firefox install)
 * B - save the url of the current website into a "bookmarks" file
